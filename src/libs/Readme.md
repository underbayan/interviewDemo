"Libs" refer to the libraries or modules that contain code that is meant to be reusable across different parts of an application. In the context of the specified constraint, the code in "libs" should not contain any mutations logic. Rather, it should be focused on providing functionalities that are shared across different parts of the application without altering any data. For instance, "libs" could contain helper functions, utility classes, or any other non-mutating code that can be used in different parts of the application.
